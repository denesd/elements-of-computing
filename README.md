## Assembler Project

### To run assembler:

Suggestion: Use poetry to install every dependency

`poetry install && poetry shell`

First change to the assembler directory (`cd assembler`).

Run `./assembler.py <input-file>` - where the input file points to an assembly file.


### Testing

To run the test cases use `pytest tests/`.
